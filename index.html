          <h2>Introduce Yourself</h2>
          <p>
            Hi there! I'm Alexander Grattan, a Digital Narrative and Interactive
            Design major with a CS minor here at Pitt. I used to be a film
            student before transferring to Pitt (you can call me a bit of a film
            buff). I love watching the Premier League, editing videos, and
            making weird websites. And you know what else I love? Cookies. üç™

          <h2>Field of Study</h2>
          <p>
            As part of the DNID major, I exercise both sides of my brain,
            creating both technological and narrative experiences. Some of the
            things I'm interested in studying within this field include web
            development, accessibility, and human-computer interaction.

          <h2>Why UX Design and Usability Testing?</h2>
          <blockquote>"You are not the user" - someone smart</blockquote>
          <p>
            No one should be left behind when it comes to having access to
            usable and safe technology. I want to create creative and fun
            experiences that all can enjoy and usability testing is an important
            skillset to have in order to do so.

          <h2>Where do you want your knowledge and skills to take you?</h2>
          <p>
            I'm currently working for a digital design agency, however, I might
            look to further my education and study HCI at Carnegie Mellon
            University, delving into research into web accessibility. What I
            hope to gain from this class is the skills to analyze the usability
            of an interface as well as how to adaquately conduct research and
            interview participants.
